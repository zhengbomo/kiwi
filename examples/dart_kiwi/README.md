# Dart Example

An example of how to use [kiwi](https://github.com/gbtb16/kiwi/tree/master/kiwi) coupled with [kiwi_generator](https://github.com/gbtb16/kiwi/tree/master/kiwi_generator).

This is an adaptation of the "Coffee" [example from Google/Inject](https://github.com/google/inject.dart/tree/master/example/coffee).

To launch the generator, execute the following command:

```bash
pub run build_runner build
```
